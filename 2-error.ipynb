       "\"Documents missing on chemicals in Gulf - report. The U.S. Defence Department said nearly all the classified documents recording incidents of chemical weapons use during the Gulf war are missing despite an exhaustive search, the New York Times reported on Friday. The paper said copies of the logs were kept in safes at two U.S. locations, but a new report from the Defence Department indicates only 36 pages out of an estimated 200 have been found in a search by its investigators. The missing logs include those for eight days in March 1991 when U.S. troops unknowingly blew up chemical weapons in an Iraqi arms dump, the paper said. Those logs, which were maintained for Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, were first reported missing in December. Friday's paper said the new report heightens speculation about a cover-up or criminal incompetence within the Defence Department, which had denied the existence of such records before agreeing last year to release them to a veterans' group. It said the logs were recorded on floppy disks and on paper and shipped to the headquarters of the United States Central Command in Tampa, Florida. A separate computer disk containing the information was stored at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, but nearly all the information at both sites has vanished, the Times said. The paper said the Defence Department gave its report to the Senate Armed Services Committee this month but had not yet planned to release it to the public.\""

The project to build a petrochemical plant is a joint venture with the state China National Offshore Oil Corporation and has been under discussion since 1971 Ye said the plants was expected to produce 85 million tonnes a year of ethylene, having been raised from previous plans for 45 million tonnes of annual capacity. Ye also said that plans for a refinery at the same site remained on hold. \"To ensure a better return for the project we have decided not to build a refinery at the same time but to import\" petroleum projects to supply the petrochemical complex, he said. The original project had been valued at $6 billion, including the originally-projected 160,000 barrels per day oil refinery. A spokesman for Shell in London declined to comment on Ye Qing\\'s statement.'"

       "'Australian Jews scan Swiss Holocaust bank list. Hundreds of relatives of Jewish Holocaust victims living in Australia could be eligible for funds in Swiss banks after the publication of more than 2,000 pre-1945 accounts, Jewish officials said on Wednesday. While only four Australian names were on the list, Australia boasts the world\\'s fourth largest Jewish population, due to large scale post-World War Two migration. \"There are more Jews of Polish decent living in Australia than there are Jews living in Poland,\" said Jeremy Jones, spokesman for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. \"There could potentially be hundreds (of relatives) on this list, but we do not believe that this list is comprehensive or exhaustive. This is the list from the Swiss banks: it is not a list discovered by any independent audit,\" Jones told Reuters. The Swiss Bankers Association took out a double-page advertisement in The Australian national newspaper, listing more than 2,000 pre-1945 accounts, including assets by Holocaust victims. The list included four Australian men. \"We imagine of the thousands of names many of those will not have any living relatives because of the extent of the Nazi genocide,\" Jones said. However, Jones said the publication of the list will make it easier for relatives of Holocaust victims to claim funds. Swiss bank sources on Tuesday said the total amount in dormant accounts was around US$40 million rather than US$29 million as the banks said last year. \"They are now saying we have this list and the issue is proving a relationship, which is easier,\" Jones said. \"We certainly hope this is an indication that the Swiss banks will no longer demand every receipt and deposit slip and every account number,\" he said. Jones said Australian Jews had mixed feelings about the publication of the list. \"We are happy, but why has it taken 52 years to happen. There has been a large level abrogation of morality,\" he said. On Saturday, a Sydney Jewish family said it had made a successful claim for funds belonging to a Holocaust victim held in a Swiss bank. The deal was done three weeks ago in Zurich between Sydney accountant Stephen Baruch and the Union Bank of Switzerland, Baruch told Reuters. The Australian newspaper reported Jewish community sources saying the amount, based on an original deposit of 600 pounds sterling in 1938, was now worth more than US$154,000. Baruch said that was an exaggeration.'"

      "Tuzla mayor warns Germany against refugee return. German plans to forcibly repatriate thousands of refugees to former Yugoslavia will exacerbate tensions in Bosnia and cause untold suffering, the mayor of the northern Bosnian city of Tuzla said on Wednesday. Selim Beslagic appealed to state governments to reconsider their decision to start the compulsory return of some of the 320,000 refugees now living in Germany, warning that Bosnia could not cope with a flood of refugees. \"You cannot solve the problem by simply chasing people out,\" Beslagic said at a news conference in Bonn. \"We want the refugees to return to Bosnia too, but it has to be carefully prepared to avoid further tensions.\" Germany's 16 federal states ignored international criticism and decided last month to begin sending home Bosnians who took refuge here from the Balkan war. States such as Bavaria and Berlin, whose budgets have been hit by costly support payments, have taken a hard line. Bavaria's interior minister Guenther Beckstein rejected criticism that the southern German state, where some 65,000 refugees are living, was hurriedly trying to force the Bosnians to leave. He said that only a few thousand would be deported. \"Anyone who suggests we are giving these people the big heave-ho or planning mass deportations is misleading the public,\" Beckstein said. He added Bavaria would begin deporting criminals this week, followed by single working age people. Berlin told 1,500 unmarried people and childless couples to leave Germany by the end of October. Haunted by their own memories of war and its aftermath, many Germans at first took in the Bosnians with open arms. While there is still widespread sympathy for them, poorer states say they cannot indefinitely pay the hundreds of millions of marks (dollars) it costs to house and feed the refugees. \"It would be extremely bad if the people are forced to return before the winter,\" Beslagic said. He added it would take another two or three years before the majority could return. Tuzla had a pre-war population of 133,000 and while some 20,000 left during the war, another 48,000 refugees from other parts of former Yugoslavia are now living in the city. \"We have no housing and no work...It would be a human disaster,\" the mayor said. The efforts by Bavaria and Berlin to return their refugees drew criticism on Wednesday from Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, the government's special commissioner on foreigners' affairs. She said Bavaria appeared to be more concerned with speed than safety in repatriating the Bosnians. \"The most important goal should not be getting the refugees out in one big push,\" said Schmalz-Jacobsen, who in principle endorses the move to begin compulsory repatriation. \"Rather the most important goal should be resettling the refugees permanently and safely in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\" she said. \"The other preconditions for a return are the conditions of reconstruction which exist in the region.\"\n",

      "U.N. urges Israel to stop new housing in E.Jerusalem. The U.N. General Assembly, by a vote of 130 to 2, with 2 abstentions, called on Israel on Thursday to abandon plans to build new Jewish housing in Arab East Jerusalem. The United States and Israel cast the only negative votes on the resolution, similar to one vetoed by the United States in the Security Council last Friday. Micronesia and the Marshall Islands abstained. Arab states, frustrated by last week's veto, transferred the issue to the 185-nation Assembly, where there is no veto. Although the Assembly's decisions are not binding, the aim was to obtain an expression of almost universal opposition to Israel's action. Virtually all speakers in both the Assembly and council debates criticised the decision to build 6,500 homes for Jews on a tree-covered hill between East Jerusalem and Bethlehem that Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East war. The area is called Har Homa by Israel and Jabal Abu Ghneim by the Palestinians. Israel regards Jerusalem as its undivided capital while the Palestinians regard East Jerusalem as the capital of an eventual Palestinian state. Speakers said the Israeli action harmed the Middle East peace process by pre-empting so-called \"final status\" talks due to start soon between Israel and the Palestinians on such issues as Jerusalem and settlements. They also said the planned new neighbourhood would violate the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians in time of war, which bars settlements in occupied territory. Ambassador Bill Richardson of the United States criticised Israel's decision, as he did in the council. But referring to the peace process, he said the Assembly \"ought not to interject itself into this process, which can only build mistrust and harden the positions of both sides while interfering with the progress the parties are making on their own.\" Speaking before the Assembly vote, Israeli U.N. envoy David Peleg called the resolution biased and detrimental to peace efforts. He indirectly criticised the European Union, whose 15 members were among the resolution's more than 50 sponsors, saying: \"It is difficult to comprehend that countries who wish to play a more active role in the Middle East peace process are rushing to support and even co-sponsor such a blatantly one-sided resolution. Their actions are completely incompatible with their wishes.\" Referring to the killing of six Israeli schoolgirls and their teacher by a Jordanian soldier earlier in the day, he said: \"This terrible crime reinforces our belief that the only way to promote peace in the Middle East, to support the political process and to fight terrorism, is through direct talks.\" The Palestine Liberation Organisation's U.N. Observer, Nasser al-Kidwa, said the Assembly vote \"sends a clear, unmistakable message to all parties...that Israel should indeed stop its plans to construct the Jabal Abu Ghneim settlement and refrain from further settlement activities.\" It also showed there was a central role for the United Nations, \"especially when a state like Israel violates the humanitarian international law and relevant United Nations resolutions, as well as the bilateral agreements reached\" under the peace process, he added. The Assembly resolution expresses \"deep concern at the decision of the government of Israel to initiate new settlement activities in the Jabal Abu Ghneim area in East Jerusalem.\" It calls on Israel to \"refrain from all actions or measures, including settlement activities, which alter the facts on the ground, pre-empting the final status negotiations, and have negative implications for the Middle East peace process.\"\n",

      "U.S. urges China to free ex-official Bao Tong. The United States called on China on Tuesday to release a former senior Chinese official who has been held under house arrest since completing a jail term in May. Bao Tong, 63, was freed from prison on May 27 after a serving a seven-year sentence that grew out of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in China, but he has been held since then at a dormitory of the State Council, or Cabinet, near Beijing. \"We very much have protested the fact that he's been held in detention without recourse to judicial representation, without any access to his family,\" State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. \"We've called upon the Chinese government to let him return home so he can seek proper medical care and he can be a free person ... We very much hope that the Chinese government will take action to redress this.\" Burns told reporters Washington was \"very concerned\" about Bao's treatment and had raised the matter at the highest levels of the Chinese government. Bao, a former aide to former Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, was convicted of \"counterrevolutionary incitement\" and the leaking of state secrets. Diplomats in Beijing say he is a source of anxiety for China's leaders, who fear he may reveal details of his dealings with the highest party echelons in the weeks before the bloody 1989 crackdown on demonstrators. It was unclear why the State Department had decided to publicise the matter now.\n",

      "Ex-Thai foreign minister target of grenade attack. An unidentified bomber hurled a hand grenade into the compound of former Thai foreign minister Prasong Soonsiri early on Wednesday, damaging his car but not causing any injuries, police said. Radio and television quoted Prasong, now a newspaper columnist and outspoken critic of the cabinet, as accusing the government of being behind the attack. \"This was a politically motivated attack. Someone in the ruling coalition was responsible for this evil act,\" said Prasong, now a columnist of Naew Nah (Front Line) newspaper. Deputy Interior Minister Chalerm Yubamrung last week accused Prasong of fomenting rumours of an impending coup against the government of Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. Chavalit, wrestling with an economic crisis and political tensions, has faced growing public criticism for his government decisions to raise value added tax (VAT) and suspend more than half of Thailand's 91 finance companies.\n",

      "Lake pessimistic on Northern Ireland talks. Peace talks in Northern Ireland seem unlikely to produce a ceasefire with the Irish Republican Army, U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake said on Sunday. \"The talks frankly are not going well,\" Lake said on NBC television's \"Meet the Press.\" He said even if the IRA agreed to a truce, \"there's always a danger that a ceasefire could again be broken.\" IRA guerrilla forces broke a 17-month ceasefire last February. The British and Irish governments insist on a new truce before all-party talks on British rule in Northern Ireland can begin. \"The president and all of us are working very hard to try to bring about both a ceasefire and then comprehensive and inclusive talks,\" Lake said of the two-year effort led by former Sen. George Mitchell to bring the parties together. \"I hope all of the parties and governments involved, if they look at the alternatives for Northern Ireland, realise that it's time to compromise, time not to get too involved in the details and move forward,\" he said.\n",

      "Cyprus' Clerides rejects British fears of war. Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides on Tuesday dismissed Britain's warning of a serious possibility of Greece and Turkey going to war over Cyprus. \"Any such act would put Turkey in complete disarray with the countries of Europe,\" Clerides told a news conference in New Delhi, where he arrived on Monday on a six-day visit. \"I wish to stress that it will be a serious move if Turkey tried to militarily expand into the Greek part of Cyprus,\" Clerides said. \"Because we have concluded an agreement with Greece on common defence, and that would involve a possibility of war, not merely a war between Cyprus and Turkey, which neither the United States wants, nor NATO nor anybody else, because it would destabilise the eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans.\" Clerides was responding to remarks by British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind earlier on Tuesday that he feared war could break out between North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) allies Turkey and Greece in the Aegean. \"When relations are already bad and tense and difficult and both sides appear to be looking for an excuse to make them worse, that is pretty grim,\" Rifkind told BBC Radio. \"I am not as confident as logic would imply because there has been a real lack of political will on both sides,\" he added. Rifkind visited the divided island last December. Clerides responded: \"I would refer him to the (United Nations) Secretary-General's report where he stated the reason that there is no progress in the solution of the Cyprus problem is because of the lack of political will of the Turkish Cypriot leadership. \"He said his good offices could do nothing when one side, the Turkish side, flouts international opinion.\" Separately, Greece said Rifkind's comments were unjust and blamed Ankara for the tension. \"The suggestions should be addressed to Turkey, which has an occupation force on Cyprus, it violates our airspace and threatens to use force in the Aegean in violation of international law,\" Greece's Press and Information Minister Dimitris Reppas told reporters in Athens. Clerides defended Cyprus' decision to buy Russian surface-to-air missiles. Britain expressed alarm last month over the purchase, saying it could destabilise what is already one of the most heavily militarised areas of the world. The planned acquisition of the S-300 system would neutralise the air superiority Turkey has enjoyed since 1974, when its troops invaded the northern one-third of Cyprus in response to a short-lived coup engineered by the military government then ruling Greece. Turkey and the United States had threatened to block the missile system's deployment and had warned Cyprus of military action, Clerides said. He said the missiles would not be delivered for 16 months, leaving \"ample time\" for Turkey to launch an initiative to resolve the long-simmering dispute, which would entail the demilitarisation of Cyprus. Asked about the possibility of talks between leaders from both sides of the divided island, Clerides said: \"We cannot start with a top-level meeting unless there is evidence that the other side is prepared to negotiate.\"\n",

      "Swiss Holocaust fund may not be okayed--NYC Hevesi. [CORRECTED 21:44 GMT] New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who met last week with Swiss bank and government officials, said Wednesday a proposed $4.83 billion fund for Holocaust victims and their survivors might never be approved. \"There is no guarantee that the Solidarity Fund will ever be created,\" Hevesi said in prepared remarks. \"The fund must be approved by a referendum and virtually every government official, community leader and banker I spoke to thought that approval would be difficult.\" The Solidarity Fund requires a constitutional amendment (corrects by removing incorrect statement of who would pay for the fund). Hevesi said the political requirement for the amendment \"is such that approval is unlikely.\" Hevesi also said the fund might not be available for up to eight years. And Hevesi said the Swiss banks agree that the Swiss government should take charge of any unclaimed dormant accounts (corrects from 'Swiss Government should run the proposed fund). Hevesi is holding a press conference on Wednesday at his offices here to discuss his trip and findings. --U.S. Municipal Desk, 212-859-1650\n",

      "Netanyahu approves oil drilling on Golan - paper. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved a request by a state-owned company to drill for oil on the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war, Israel's Haaretz newspaper said on Friday. Netanyahu spokesman Shai Bazak said he was checking the report. Haaretz said the National Oil Company made the request. It said, however, that actual drilling could be held up indefinitely, despite Netanyahu's approval in principle, by a recent decision to privatise the oil company. Legal reviews of the request have still to be completed, the daily said. Nearly five years of sporadic peace talks between Israel and Syria have long stalled over the strategic heights. Damascus demands a full Israeli withdrawal. Israel's previous government, ousted by Netanyahu in May elections, was ready to make at least a partial withdrawal for full peace and normal ties with Syria. Netanyahu rejects trading occupied Arab land for peace.\n",

      "Most Israelis fear outbreak of war - poll. Sixty percent of Israelis fear the outbreak of a Middle East war, according to an opinion poll published on Wednesday. A Panorama Marketing Institute poll published in the Israeli daily Maariv found that Israelis are increasingly apprehensive about the future. Only 37 percent believed their country was on the right track, down from 48 percent in a similar poll released four months ago. Thirty-seven percent of the survey's respondents rated Israel's security situation \"good\" or \"very good\", down from 56 percent in July. Only 30 percent felt the Jewish state's world standing was better than in the past, compared to 56 percent in the previous poll. Israel's relations with Arab states have soured since its right-wing government took office in June. Israeli Prime Minister Benajmain Netanyahu's rejection of the \"land-for-peace\" principle underlying five years of Arab-Israeli peace talks has led to an escalation of tensions between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbours. The survey of 1,003 adults had a margin of error of three percent.\n",

      "Turkish government approves Islamist crackdown. Turkey's Islamist-led government said on Thursday it would rigorously implement a crackdown on religious activism demanded by the secularist military. \"The (army's) decisions will be sincerely enforced,\" Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller told reporters after a cabinet meeting. Istanbul stocks soared on hopes of government stability. Orders from the military-dominated National Security Council (MGK) to carry out a list of anti-Islamist demands had caused friction in Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's ruling alliance. \"The prime minister and I both gave clear orders to the relevant ministries to implement the MGK decisions in the short term, medium term and long term,\" said Ciller, head of the coalition's pro-Western wing. \"Our government is committed against the reactionary danger,\" said cabinet spokesman Lutfu Esengun, from Erbakan's Welfare Party (RP). Neither gave details of specific action the government would take. Political analysts say Erbakan should have little difficulty in giving concessions to the army on issues he does not see as directly affecting his grassroots support, like getting tough on religious extremists. But he will have problems consenting to the generals' demands that the coalition legislate against peaceful Islamist dissent and restrict the number of religious secondary schools, known as \"Imam Hatips\". Many supporters of the Welfare Party and some of Erbakan's ministers were educated at religious shcools. Ciller's True Path Party (DYP) has also encouraged religious education. \"Any compromise that ends with the closure of Imam Hatips and the abuse of human rights and freedoms will be a decree of death for the DYP and RP,\" columnist Fehmi Koru wrote in the Zaman daily, a moderate Islamist paper that often criticises Erbakan. Welfare had upset the army in recent months with plans to increase the role of Islam in public life. The generals replied with orders for a return to the rigid secularism of the 1920s, when republican Turkey was rising from the ashes of the religion-based Ottoman Empire. Other army demands include enforcing a ban on Islamic dress and halting the recent growth in Islamic brotherhoods, known as \"tarikats\". The military row has led to speculation that the military would staged its fourth coup since 1960 and has distracted from Erbakan's initial success in an ambitious privatisation programme. The Istanbul stock market's general index closed 67 points, or 4.66 percent, higher at 1,504. \"There was an overall buying activity on positive news about the cabinet meeting,\" said Serdar Karatepe from Polen securities. Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, came to power last year after narrowly winning 1995 elections with 21 percent of the vote. The secularist majority complain he has no mandate to change the country's system.\n",

      "Jewish group uses Internet in Swiss bank move. A prominent Jewish group on Tuesday put the names of 1,500 Holocaust victims and survivors who deposited money in Swiss bank accounts on the worldwide computer Internet in a bid to help them or their heirs recover the money. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles, named after the famous Nazi hunter, announced that it had created a special World Wide Web page at http://www.wiesenthal.com to publicise the names. Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the centre, told a news conference he hoped putting the names on the Internet would lead to the heirs of the depositors, and perhaps even the depositors themselves if they were still alive, lodging claims against Swiss Bank Corp. Hier said the list was supplied to the centre by Swiss Bank Corp., one of three major Swiss banks being sued by American Jews who believe their money, or the money of their dead relatives to which they are entitled, is being held by those banks. The other two Swiss financial institutions involved in the litigation are the Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Credit Bank, Hier said. He said Swiss Bank Corp. had disclosed that the accounts held 13.5 million Swiss Francs at the 1941 level. Given a \"modest, four percent interest rate and we go to 1997 that would be worth 116 million Swiss Francs or $94 million,\" Hier said. Hier said he expected the other two banks to also provide a list of blocked accounts that have since become dormant because the banks have been unable to locate the depositors or their heirs. The addresses of the depositors, which were also being placed on the Internet, showed they lived in a variety of European countries as well as the United States and Canada when they opened their accounts. Hier said he did not know how many people would have a legitimate claim against Swiss Bank Corp., because some of the accounts already may have been closed after depositors withdrew their money during the years after the war. American researchers believe up to 50 percent of the accounts may have been closed. Hier also unveiled a list of 334 Nazis who the centre believes deposited plundered money and gold in Swiss bank accounts during the war. Prominent among them were Adolf Eichmann, who was subsequently executed in Israel for war crimes; Klaus Barbie, the Gestapo chief in Lyon, France, who was convicted of war crimes in that city; Eva Braun, Adolf Hitler's mistress whom he married during the last hours of his life; Martin Bormann, Hitler's private secretary, and Luftwaffe head Hermann Goering. The list was sent to Switzerland President Arnold Koller by the centre earlier this month with a request to the Swiss government to check if any of those on it had opened bank accounts during the Second World War. Other names on the list include Rudolf Hoess, commandant of Auschwitz, the notorious Nazi death camp, from 1940 to 1943, and Josef Mengele, an Auschwitz doctor who performed experiments on inmates and who died in Brazil in 1979.\n",

      "Apartheid hitman says Palme killer in Mozambique. A self-confessed apartheid killer said on Saturday he knew the identity of the man who assassinated Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986. Dirk Coetzee, stoking the growing belief in a South African connection to Palme's unsolved murder, told Swedish television that the killer lived in Mozambique. \"There is no doubt that South Africa was behind the murder of Olof Palme, no doubt at all,\" said Coetzee, who is due to stand trial in December for a murder he has already confessed to carrying out as an apartheid hit squad leader. Coetzee said the man was connected with Craig Williamson, accused in a Pretoria court on Thursday of being behind Palme's murder. The man who made the accusation, Eugene de Kock, was Coetzee's successor as head of the hit squad. Williamson has denied the charges. Coetzee, asked by a Swedish television reporter if his information was based on hearsay, acknowledged he did not have first-hand information about the man he accused of carrying out the assassination. \"Hearsay is exactly what we work with in the secret police,\" he said. Coetzee appealed to Swedish authorities to take the new information on Palme's murder seriously. \"What I am saying now will be confirmed 100 percent. You will come back to me and tell me \"now we know you are speaking the truth'.\" The Swedish news agency TT quoted Coetzee as telling the South African newspaper Beeld on Saturday that 80 or 90 South African agents took part in the planning for Palme's murder. Both De Kock and Coetzee spoke of \"Operation Long Reach\", a plan by apartheid-era hit squads to eliminate high-profile opponents of South Africa's apartheid regime. Palme, a fiery orator well-known for defending Third World minorities, was a vocal enemy of apartheid. Swedish newspapers reported on Saturday that police knew Williamson had been in Sweden at the time of Palme's death but that he had not been anywhere near the central Stockholm street where the prime minister was shot dead late at night while walking home with his wife. A possible South African connection was first mooted in the Swedish press in 1987. But it did not appear to have been taken seriously by detectives investigating the assassination, who rarely mentioned it as a serious possibility. Instead, Swedish police have favoured the theory of a loner with a grudge against the leftwing Palme carrying out a spontaneous killing and disappearing afterwards. Swedish police have been wallowing in controversy since the killing. Several police chiefs have resigned over the number of blunders made during the investigation.\n",

      "Ex-Philippine rebel leader vows to help farmers. Former Moslem rebel leader Nur Misuari, who last year traded his guns for peace in the southern Philippines, on Tuesday vowed to help coconut farmers increase productivity. \"At one time you were under the influence of people who did nothing but exploit you, stole the little that you had. Now we intend to rectify all of this,\" Misuari told an audience of farmers. He said improving the lot of coconut farmers was a priority because they comprised a large section of the population of southern Mindanao where Misuari waged a guerrilla war for more than 20 years. Last year, his Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) agreed to a peace deal with the government under which Misuari was appointed chairman of an interim body called the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development. The council is the forerunner to an autonomous region in the southern Philippines. Clad in a business suit and sitting at a table with a host of farmers and government officials, Misuari said farmers needed to lobby the government for their needs. \"Farmers, if you want to fight for your rights you need to have someone to speak on your behalf against the mighty power in our society,\" Misuari said referring to a widely held belief that politics and high government posts in the country were the preserve of a few elite families. Misuari said since the signing the peace pact, several foreign investors had expressed interest in investing in Mindanao, believed to be the Philippines' richest region in mineral and natural gas resources.\n",

      "Afghan Taleban resist pressure to expel Saudi. A senior Taleban official said on Thursday that they will not bow to any pressure to expel Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden from Afghan territory they control. \"We will never give in to pressure from anyone to expel bin Laden,\" acting Taleban Information Minister Amir Khan Mutaqi told journalists on Thursday. He said that in a meeting on Tuesday between bin Laden and the head of the Taleban movement, Mullah Mohammed Omar, bin Laden had been asked to soften his line on Saudi Arabia. \"Osama bin Laden was invited to meet the Amir al-Momineen (a title given to Omar which means leader of the faithful) and asked if he could soften his line on Saudi Arabia,\" said Mutaqi. In a recent interview with a British newspaper, bin Laden said he would continue his efforts to drive United States troops out of Saudi Arabia. The United States have accused bin Laden of being behind two explosions in Saudi Arabia which killed 24 U.S. servicemen and two Indians, and injured over 400 others in 1995 and 1996. Mutaqi said on Thursday that other Islamic countries should not be worried about bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. The Taleban have said that they will not allow Afghan soil to be used for the training of terrorists or as a base for operations against other countries. \"The meeting between bin Laden and the Amir al-Momineen was designed to ensure Muslim countries that they should not be worried about bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan.\" he said. Mutaqi said that the United States and other western countries was magnifying the significance of bin Laden as a justification for the continued presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. Mutaqi said that no requests had been received by the Taleban to extradite bin Laden. \"The United States and other western countries are trying to make a major issue out of bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan because they want to strengthen their presence in Saudi Arabia.\" said Mutaqi.\n",

He told reporters in Belgrade after a meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic that if Karadzic and his allies sought \"confrontation, they will get it... they must, must change their behaviour\". Gelbard spoke after Plavsic threatened to dissolve the Bosnian Serb parliament to prevent Karadzic and hardliners whom she has accused of corruption from using their majority to force her from power at a session scheduled for Friday. A Bosnian television report from the hardliners' stronghold in Pale, outside Sarajevo, said NATO peacekeepers had been ordered to arrest Karadzic and his wartime army commander General Ratko Mladic on sight. If confirmed, the report would signal a shift in strategy by the West which has in the past shrunk from arresting Karadzic because of the risk of renewed conflict. Gelbard is in the region to represent the five-nation Contact Group which has underwritten the Bosnian peace agreement and which tacitly sided with Plavsic on Wednesday. Gelbard did not side explicitly with Plavsic, who was democratically elected last year, but said: \"The United States supports the full implementation of the Dayton (peace) agreements and we will suport those who will carry out the Dayton agreements.\" Western countries fear the crisis between Plavsic and Karadzic, who has kept covert control of Bosnian Serb government, could derail the peace process. Gelbard was due to meet Momcilo Krajisnik, a senior Karadzic ally and Serb member of Bosnia's multi-ethnic collective presidency, later in the day. He said the activites of Karadzic, Krajisnik and Bosnian Serb police chief Dragan Kijac \"have been extremely dangerous\". Kijac's police had set up illegal roadblocks and threatened U.S. troops serving with the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR) in Bosnia. Plavsic cited a constitutional crisis as the basis for a possible presidential order to dissolve the parliament, the television said. There was no comment on the letter from Plavsic's office in the northern town of Banja Luka, where policemen loyal to the president are guarding her building. British soldiers in the NATO-led peace force patrolled the streets of Banja Luka overnight to prevent violence from erupting between Plavsic's supporters, who include army generals, and Karadzic's police force. The ruling Serb Democratic Party nominated Plavsic for the presidency last year in the belief she would prove an obedient successor, but she has condemned the leadership as corrupt war profiteers. Karadzic, who led separatist Serbs during the 1992-95 war, was forced to step down from office under international pressure last year and promised to stay out of politics. Scoffing at his indictment by the U.N. war crimes tribunal, he continues to wield covert influence over his party in a bid to obstruct the peace accords. Plavsic, like Karadzic, is an ultra-nationalist ideologue but has argued for cooperating with the international community to preserve Serb interests under the U.S.-brokered peace treaty.\n",

      "Karen rebels reject Burma's peace offer. Rebel ethnic Karen guerrillas, who operate along the forested southeastern border with Thailand, said on Saturday that they had rejected the latest peace overture from Burma's military government. Leader of the rebel Karen National Union (KNU), General Bo Mya, told Reuters from Hteet Kaple at the southeastern border with Thailand that the offer was rejected because Rangoon had insisted the KNU lay down its arms for talks to progress. Earlier, a spokesman for Burma's ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) had told a monthly news conference that the government was awaiting the outcome of a new round of peace talks with the KNU. Spokesman Colonel Kyaw Thein said that some influential Karen nationals from Rangoon were meeting with the KNU leaders to persuade them to make peace with the government. They had reached the KNU headquarters three days ago and the outcome of the talks was awaited, he added. Guerrilla leader Bo Mya said the KNU was not prepared to lose its honour during the talks by laying down arms. \"SLORC has sent representatives to ask us to lay down arms to pave the way for talks,\" he said. \"But we turned that down.\" The KNU was formed in 1948 to fight for autonomy from Rangoon shortly after Burma gained independence from Britain. The KNU is the only remaining armed group still fighting Burma's military government and several rounds of peace talks in the past have failed. This week the KNU and its rival, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), a splinter group backed by the Burmese government, have been engaged in heavy fighting that has left thousands of refugee Karens homeless.\n",

      "Plane from China lands at Philippines' Clark base. An unscheduled Boeing 737 aircraft arrived at Clark airbase just north of Manila from Xiamen, China on Tuesday but it was not immediately known if North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop was on board, a Manila airport official said. Alger Ramo, supervising air traffic controller at the Manila international airport, said information he received indicated \"several people\" disembarked from the plane after it touched at 12:23 p.m. (0423 gmt).   Ramo said the plane sought airport clearance just a few minutes before it landed at Clark, about 80 km (50 miles) north of Manila. Ramo was speaking to air traffic controllers at Clark who told him they saw a number of people getting off the aircraft. Desiree Domingo, air traffic controller at nearby Subic Bay airport, also confirmed the arrival of the flight from China. A China Southern Airlines flight CZ379 carrying a mysterious VIP passenger took off on Tuesday morning from the southeastern city of Xiamen, bound for the Philippines. It was not immediately clear if it was the same plane that landed at Clark.\n",

      "Opposition parties want in on Zaire peace talks. President Mobutu Sese Seko and his civil war rival Laurent Kabila have agreed in principle to peace talks in South Africa as others involved in Zaire's power struggle demanded a place at the table. U.N. and Organisation of African Unity (OAU) special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun said in Cape Town on Thursday Mobutu and Kabila, whose rebel forces control half of Zaire, would meet face-to-face for the first time to discuss transitional arrangements leading up to elections. Sahnoun paid tribute to South African President Nelson Mandela for brokering the agreement to talk, adding: \"Now they are agreed that there will be a meeting at the highest level, I think it is a remarkable achievement in view of the complexity of the issue.\" Sahnoun and South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said in a joint statement President Mandela had formally invited Mobutu to meet Kabila in South Africa \"as early as possible\". \"We are confident that a meeting will be held soon and will discuss transitional arrangements affecting all elements of government in the context of a peaceful and negotiated solution (to the civil war),\" they said in the statement. Pahad told a news conference the two sides agreed to the talks without preconditions. Mobutu had previously insisted that a ceasefire should precede negotiations and Kabila has said there would be no ceasefire before Mobutu resigns. \"The fact of the commitment is there now. It's just a matter of setting up the detailed arrangements. We are confident that both parties are seeking a solution,\" he said. Pahad said the peace process would have to involve other political groups in Zaire at some stage, but said it should be up to that country and not outsiders to decide when or who. \"I suspect that there will be other players participating in the process, but it is an issue that must be determined by the Zaireans themselves,\" he said. In Kinshasa, powerful opposition member of parliament Andre Boboliko told Reuters the radical opposition led by populist former prime minister Etienne Tshisekedi would be entitled to join talks because of its long campaign for democracy. \"There is armed opposition, a non-armed opposition and those in power. Real negotiations have to include all three forces,\" said Boboliko, a deputy speaker of parliament. Sahnoun pointed out in Cape Town that the government delegation to the initial proximity talks in Cape Town early in March had included representatives of opposition groups in Kinshasa, including Tshisekedi's group. He said the transitional arrangements referred to in the statement would be in preparation for democratic elections in the country ruled by Mobutu for 32 years. Mandela told reporters on Thursday he was confident of a solution to the civil war that has left Kabila in control of more than half the country and said Mobutu would cooperate. \"He is very cooperative, but what he is going to do eventually I cannot predict. I believe he, himself, has an interest in a negotiated settement,\" Mandela added. A government source said Mandela would try to steer the two sides toward a settlement that included all factions claiming power or influence in Zaire. \"The important thing for the president is that nobody should be left out...he wants a coalition that leaves nobody on the outside,\" the source said. The Swiss government on Thursday rejected demands by Zairean rebels and Swiss politicians that it freeze billions of dollars Mobutu may have deposited in Swiss banks. The cabinet said Mobutu was still head of state. Kabila returned on Thursday to Lubumbashi, the mining capital taken by his forces recently, after talks with Mandela in Cape Town, but did not appear at a rally where he was scheduled to speak. The thrill of revolution which last week seized the once elegant city, formerly known as Elisabethville, has been diluted by uncertainty, which locals say will not be dispelled until the leader appears in public.\n",

      "Trial starts of China dissident Wang Dan. The Beijing People's Intermediate Court began the trial on Wednesday of prominent dissident Wang Dan on the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government, court officials said.   \"The trial started at 9.00 a.m. (0100 GMT),\" said a court official reached by telephone. He declined to give further details. Security was tight around the court building in western Beijing, with dozens of police preventing the public from approaching the building and manning roadblocks to prevent access.\n",

      "Iran seen isolated eighteen years after revolution. Iran's ties with much of the outside world show little sign of improvement eighteen years after the country's tumultuous Islamic Revolution, analysts and Tehran-based Western diplomats said on Monday. With no thawing in relations between Washington and Tehran and nagging pains with its trade partners in Europe, Iran is one of the world's most diplomatically isolated states, they said. Even ties with it Gulf Arab neighbours, notably Saudi Arabia and Iraq, are riddled with suspicion, disputes over territorial sovereignty and accusations of meddling in domestic affairs. Tehran has moved to build an alternative diplomatic game plan focused on Europe, Central Asian republics and Moslem states, most notably in a new grouping of Iran, Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia. European ties, particularly with Germany, France and Italy have been pursued by Tehran to break U.S. attempts to isolate it, wagering that Europeans would be reluctant to forego potential Iranian markets by matching U.S trade sanctions. But Iran's full participation at the diplomatic high table, despite renewed approaches to Russia, China and Japan, is still severely hampered by its confrontation with the United States, diplomats and analysts said. \"The relationship with America is still plagued by the memory of the Shah's overthrow, the mistaken intelligence analysis and the deep-seated resentment that followed the seizure of the (former American) embassy,\" said one Western diplomat. The embassy, where militants held U.S. staff for 444 days, is now a military training college. Its outer wall has a painted slogan promising America further defeats. Speculation that U.S. President Clinton's second term could see a revision and softening of U.S. containment policy towards Iran has been quickly dashed. U.S. officials over the weekend denying secret talks between the two countries. \"The U.S. administration still seems set on its dual containment policy against Iran and Iraq...With the (Republican) majority in Congress it still has to take a hardline,\" said Terence Taylor, assistant director at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. Washington has slapped unprecedented economic sanctions against Tehran after branding it as a leading supporter of international terrorism intent on derailing the Middle East peace process and condemned it for seeking nuclear weapons and as a growing military threat to oil-rich Gulf Arab neighbours. Last summer Washington issued a bill that imposes sanctions on foreign firms that invest more than $40 million in Libyan and Iranian oil and gas sectors. Tehran, which has vigorously denied charges of terrorism and justified its rearmament after its 1980-88 war with Iraq as defensive, says the United States has sought to recapture its hegemony in the region, lost after the Iranian revolution. Iran's relationship with Germany -- Tehran's main European trading partner and a leading advocate of maintaining a \"critical dialogue\" with Iran -- is also under pressure from a pending German court decision on the 1992 killings of three Kurdish dissidents and their translator in a Berlin restaurant. \"If the court comes out and explicitly says there is evidence that the murders were fully backed and carried out by the Iranian government then real problems will be created for us on the ground,\" one European diplomat in Tehran said. Several European Union diplomats are closely watching for the reaction of the German government to the court decision and said that they would be prepared to remove embassy personnel from Iran if they felt it was warranted. Bonn-Tehran ties are also snared over the case of Iranian journalist Faraj Sarkuhi arrested by Iranian authorities for allegedy trying to leave the country illegally. Bonn has asked Tehran to explain reports that Sarkuhi had not only been detained and tortured for 47 days last year when he was supposedly in Germany but had been arrested again. Fuller diplomatic ties with the European Union are also being stalled by the fatwa against British author Salman Rushdie issued by Iran's late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei in 1989 because of alleged blasphemy in Rushdie's \"The Satanic Verses.\" Domestic risks for any Iranian politician seeking any softening with Washington were highlighted by recent sermons by the country's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei which have fanned calls for the death of the United States and Israel. Crowds in Tehran on Monday marked the fall of the Shah by adopting a resolution reaffirming Iran's revolutionary zeal. \"If the American statesmen in continuation of their hostile policies against Iran make a foolish move, they and their puppet regimes will face the revolutionary wrath and retaliation of the Iranian nation,\" the English-language version of the resolution, released by the state news agency IRNA, said.\n",
